/*
Package stomp provides operations that allow communication with a 
message broker that supports the STOMP protocol.

STOMP is the Streaming Text-Oriented Messaging Protocol. 
See http://stomp.github.com/ for more details.

The STOMP client supports STOMP servers that support versions 1.0, 1.1 
and 1.2 of the STOMP specifications.

The server subpackage provides a simple implementation of a STOMP server
that is useful for testing and for applications that require a simple,
STOMP-compliant message broker.
